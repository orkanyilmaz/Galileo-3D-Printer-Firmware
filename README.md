Galileo-3D-Printer-Firmware
===========================
I created a 3D printer from scratch and used an Intel Galileo as my micro controller. This firmware is for a Windows on Devices image running on an Intel Galileo board, and currently has basic support for GCode movement, temperature control/input, uploading and downloading data from a server and GCode file parsing.
